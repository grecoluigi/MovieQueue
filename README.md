MovieQueue is a simple app that lets you manage a list of movies to watch and randomly pick one from your list for those nights when you canâ€™t decide.
You can either add movies by searching for titles in any language thanks to the TMDb (The Movie Database) integration or manually add entries by filling in the movie title, year, and providing the movie poster from you photo library.
